I think we sould use mongodb for backend and create frontend with React-Native with a Feature of create account,login,logout,admin and the authorization should be session key and in the frontend we can create the pages Home, Announcement, Events, Profile etc.
we should start with the newton logic page(where we can use the official adypu id's of students for login)
